# Resumeai

Resumeai builds novel resume designs given your (or my) work experience and projects. It'll increment or decrement the font-size so your resume will fit on one page perfectly.

Resumeai uses localstorage and the appcache to persist data between uses and make the application available offline.

It also has a hidden evolutionary algorithm (press 'L' to save a design's genome to the gene pool) that if used - will make the designs progresssively more to your likeing.
